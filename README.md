# Pen-Paper

I translated this the Star Wars Pen & Paper from german into english after I played it with friends, so when you find mistakes you can send me a message.

You should create a chess like board with cardboard for combat and some smaller pieces which serve as "obstacles" on the field. 

The itemlist should be printed and cut out. 

The players have to invent their own background stories which then should be approved by the gamemaster. 

I provided the files as word-docs so you can change them the way you like. 

Have fun!
